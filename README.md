# Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Insights Generation

## Introduction

The most common type of cancer suffered by women across the world is breast cancer. In developed nations, it is ranked second after lung cancer (1). According to the facts and figures published by the American Cancer Society, around 268,600 new invasive breast cancer cases were projected to  be diagnosed in women in 2019 (2). Research and current data all support the idea that early detection, diagnosis and treatment plays a major role in influencing survival of patients.  

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program supported by the National Cancer Institute provides statistics on cancer with the aim of reducing the burden of cancer within the US population. The SEER Incidence database collects information on incidence and survival from Cancer Registries within the US, covering about 30% of the US population (3). This database is therefore the most tapped source of data for analyzing and building statistical models to predict the survival, mortality and prevalance rates among cancer patients.  

## Project Goals

The main focus of this project is to use the US Breast Cancer patient cohort data from 2010 -2016 available in the SEER Incidence Database [specifically - Incidence - SEER 18 Regs Research Data + Hurricane Katrina Impacted Louisiana Cases, Nov 2018 Sub(1975-2016 varying)] (4)to:  

1. Evaluate the percent of Breast Cancer patients based on factors such as Race, Age, Stage, Grade, Subtype, Number of In Situ tumors and Number of positive regional lymph nodes
2. Evaluate the percent distribution of Breast Cancer patients across the United States  
3.	Evaluate any correlation between breast cancer survival outcomes and socioeconomic factors such as poverty and median income levels within the state which has the highest percentage of the Breast Cancer patient population
4.	Evaluate the survival and death rates among the above mentioned groups
